# Lab Results API

This is a **FastAPI-based** API designed for managing laboratory test results, patient data, and related information. The project includes features for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting patient and test data.

## Features:
- **CRUD operations** for managing **patients**, **tests**, and **results**.
- RESTful **API endpoints** for interacting with the system.
- **Swagger UI** for testing the API and interacting with endpoints.
- **File upload functionality** for attaching files (like scanned reports) to test results.
